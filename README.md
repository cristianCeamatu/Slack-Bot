# Slack-Bot
This is a terminal based slack bot that gives you the best matched, most voted or least voted stackoverflow posts.
I choose this because I spend so much time on stackoverflow to get my answers and I thinks it is a fun thing to filter 
the posts depending on the tags and votes and what they have in their titles. So in the end the results will be posted to
slack channel where you can get it easily.<br>I am planning to improve this project by learning more about Slack Api and make this interactions on Slack
but in the limited time, I've manage to do it on the terminal.

## Built With
* Ruby
* Slack API
* Stackexchange API
* RSpec
* Rubocop
